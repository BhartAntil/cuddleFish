# cuddleFish
This was a college CompSci project to create an encrypted chat application, completed in December of 2014. 

CuddleFish is the very beginnings of what could be a larger project--if I'd had more time, 
I would have enjoyed making it into a secure audio/video chat, perhaps even with some VPN 
capabilities. The project at this point is a simple secure text chat applet.

To run the program you have to first run the server file, then run two or more instances of 
the applet file. The program can handle multiple threads, and will display the cipher text in
the console window. You type in one applet, and it encrypts your text and displays it in any 
other open applet, yet is secure in transit.

Project details and research are available in the file "Senior Project Report" pdf, inside 
the secure chat file.
